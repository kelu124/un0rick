# AD8332-devboard

Changing filter components is more or less "easy". Two places contain footprints for filters, one on the input and another on the output to the ADC.
* The input filter has three 1206 footprints (one in serial and two in parallel to input signal). 
* The output filter is a bit more complex (20MHz LPF) and composed out of 0603 SMD parts. Those are also easy to replace with an air solder station and tweezers.

More on the output filter [in here](https://github.com/kelu124/AD8332-devboard/blob/main/datasheets/datasheets/aa_filter_report.pdf).

# Overview

On this schematics, VOH/VOL1 and VIP2/VIN2 seem inverted, but the device appears to be working as well.
