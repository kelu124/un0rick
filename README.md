# un0rick

## Overview

This is a relatively simple single-channel ultrasound board. Block diagram below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/un0rick/master/images/block-diagram.png)

## Step-by-step

1. Program the fpga using a open-source toolchain to synthetise the embedded firmware.
2. Control the board fully through SPI, be it [through USB](http://un0rick.cc/un0rick/usb-setup), a [Raspberry Pi](http://un0rick.cc/un0rick/rpi-setup), or even an [arduino](http://un0rick.cc/un0rick/m5stack) (though a cheap one may not have sufficient resources to do what you want do to).
3. Set up the acquisition sequence 
4. Get the data back again 
5. Process / visualize the acquistion

I recommend using RPi, particularly W for the wireless aspects, which then becomes the board server. There's a dedicated 20x2 header. Prepared is a [python lib](https://github.com/kelu124/un0rick/tree/master/pyUn0) as well. The v1.0.0 version is RPi4 proofed.

## Two control options: usb or raspberry

* [Tutorial : Controlling it with a GPIO ribbon](http://un0rick.cc/un0rick/rpi-setup)
* [Tutorial : Controlling it with usb](http://un0rick.cc/un0rick/usb-setup)

## Examples 

* __With a Raspberry pi__

The board was connected to a single element piezo, in water, with a reflector a few centimers away, immersed in water. Pulser is set up at 25V high pulses. Control was done through a Raspberry Pi W which is used as a controler and server, another Rasbperry pi.

Acquisition is realized, with a small offset, between 32Msps and 64Msps. Data is explored a bit further.

* __With a M5Stack (or any microcontroller really)__

The board was also tested with a nice [m5stack board](http://un0rick.cc/UseCase/m5stack) ([ino file](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/4923d2af498ee07439468cc0e1ba58e79040f0c0/matty/m5stack/SPI.ino)). Below an example in image:

## Tip: reaching 128msps

Playing with the trigger, it's possible to [interleave two signals](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/matty/20180814a/20180814a-Server.ipynb) and artificially double to acquisition speed, yielding clean images.

[Source experiment](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/tree/master/matty/20180814a)

### Overview

### In detail 

It seems that the different series interleave quite nicely, even in the detail.
