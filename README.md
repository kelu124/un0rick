# This project

![](/images/un0desc.png)

Non destructive testing and imaging ultrasound modalities have been around since the '50s in . More and more ultrasound-based initiative are emerging, mostly focusing on image processing - while hardware has been left behind. Several teams have produced succesful designs for the different possible uses, mostly efforts from research laboratories. Most have been used on commercial US scanners, traditionaly used as experiment platforms, but they are not cheap, and yield very little in terms of data access and control. Others have been developped in labs, but, sadly, very few have been open-sourced. Let's tackle this!

## Picture of the setup

The board was connected to a single element piezo, in water, with a reflector a few centimers away, immersed in water. Pulser is set up at 25V high pulses.

Acquisition is realized, with a small offset, between 32Msps and 64Msps. Data is explored a bit further.

# __Nunc Ille Est Magicus__ -- Introduction

Non destructive testing and imaging ultrasound modalities have been around since the '50s in . More and more ultrasound-based initiative are emerging, mostly focusing on image processing - while hardware has been left behind. Several teams have produced succesful designs for the different possible uses, mostly efforts from research laboratories. Most have been used on commercial US scanners, traditionaly used as experiment platforms, but they are not cheap, and yield very little in terms of data access and control. Others have been developped in labs, but, sadly, very few have been open-sourced. This particular project stems from a previous beaglebone-based design, as well as an arduino-like module-based design. 

It has also been shown that simple (be it low-power, low-cost and small) can be achieved - and this, even for relatively complex systems, based on 16 to 64  parallel   channels   front-end  processing and software back-end processing (embedded PC or DSP). This makes it a bit more complex for the layman, hobbyist, or non-specialist researcher to use, not to mention the very little information that is accessible.

# __Si (Non) Confectus, (Non) Reficiat__ -- a short comparative

* Ready-made commercial platforms range in the 1000s$ .. and even smallish one-channel boards can be around 2k$. Each has pros and cons (for example a 2k$ board samples at 160Msps but can only store 4k pts). Not open-source.
* Research gigs are not always published. Not open-source.
* Some arduino-like modules were developped. A whole set is around 350$ for AFE+ADC+controls. Open source. DIY quality (acceptable, not for pros). Open source.
* This board has more or less only plusses compared to the competition =)
 

# __Quia Ego Sic Dico__ -- installation steps
