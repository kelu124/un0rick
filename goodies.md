# Some experiments

# Hardware

Apart from the un0rick and lit3rick boards, some hardware was developped, as devkits for some ultrasound related chips:

* [FT600](http://un0rick.cc/ft600) 
* [MAX14866](http://un0rick.cc/max14866) 
* [AD8332](http://un0rick.cc/ad8332) 

## Software

* Python library: [USB probes APIs]()
* Not really much here, maybe an [intro to ultrasound signal processing with raw data](https://github.com/kelu124/us_rf_processing/)

## Other
* Older [modules](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/include/AddModulesSummary.md) also where developped
