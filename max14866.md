# max14866

## What is it ?

The MAX14866 is a 16-channel, high-voltage (HV), analog SPST switch primarily intended for HV multiplexing in ultrasound applications.

The MAX14866 operates from one only low-voltage supply (+5V) and does not require dedicated HV supplies, resulting in cost-saving and system simplification.

Moreover, for in-probe applications, HV supplies do not need to be associated with the MAX14866 in the probe/transducer head, resulting in greater safety and easier compliance with safety regulations
