# What I want to do 

Become the RaspberryPi of open-source ultrasound hardware 

## What I have

* Been selling hardware since 2017: know-how in terms of design, prototyping, review, production, sales  
* Two existing board designs and corresponding python libs
* Documentation, along with an exhaustive research log
* Existing users - and access to ultrasound research labs, as well as ultrasound startups (~50+ users, including ~10 academic labs, ~10 startups, ~10 SMEs)
* An ecosystem (academics, private, researchers, students, suppliers, ...)
* A series of published articles on open-ultrasound
* A collection of old (mostly) mechanical probes
* Knowledge of the FPGA toolchain and its key actors  

## What I am looking for

* Grow: Have more users, and enlarge the users/contributors community (documentation, hardware, software), diversify the FPGA contributors base 
* Learn: Improve users feedback
* Work together: Partners to improve the design and documentation, with ad-hoc technical support (HV!)
* Coconstruct: People developing their own ultrasound research platform
* Suppliers: diversify PCBA and piezo suppliers
* Innovate: Explore more complex (still within open-tool chain) FPGAs, build on single element hardware to start 8-elements arrays
* Share: Improve a library of fpga signal processing toolss
