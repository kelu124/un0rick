# What I want to do 

Foster open-source ultrasound hardware, like arduino and raspberrypi have done.

## What I have

* Been selling hardware since 2017: know-how in terms of design, prototyping, review, production, sales  
* Two existing board designs and corresponding python libs ([un0rick](http://un0rick.cc/un0rick) and [lit3rick](http://un0rick.cc/lit3rick))!
* Documentation, along with an exhaustive research log
* Existing users - and access to ultrasound research labs, as well as ultrasound startups (~100+ users, including ~20 academic labs, ~15 startups, ~15 SMEs)
* An [ecosystem](https://join.slack.com/t/usdevkit/shared_invite/zt-2g501obl-z53YHyGOOMZjeCXuXzjZow) (academics, private, researchers, students, suppliers, ...)
* A series of published articles on open-ultrasound ([1](https://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.2/),[2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338487313_Development_of_a_Portable_and_Inexpensive_Ultrasound_Imaging_Device_for_Use_in_the_Developing_World),[3](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338491502_un0rick_open-source_fpga_board_for_single_element_ultrasound_imaging))
* A collection of old (mostly) mechanical [probes](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/include/probes/Readme.md)
* Some USB ultrasound probes - working on opening their access
* By-products of the hardware development ([usb tools](https://github.com/kelu124/ft600), [muxes](https://github.com/kelu124/max14866), [high voltage](https://github.com/kelu124/hvpppn) designs, ..)
* Knowledge of the fpga toolchain and its key actors  

## What I am looking for

* Grow: Have more users, and enlarge the users/contributors community (documentation, hardware, software), diversify the FPGA contributors base 
* Learn: Improve users feedback
* Work together: Partners to improve the design and documentation, with ad-hoc technical support (HV!)
* Coconstruct: People developing their own ultrasound research platform
* Suppliers: diversify PCBA and piezo suppliers
* Innovate: Explore more complex (still within open-tool chain) FPGAs, build on single element hardware to start 8-elements arrays
* Share: Improve a library of fpga signal processing tools

## Example of a partnership

A derivated work has been developped in the partnership with the [National Research Council ](https://nrc.canada.ca/en)which cocreated the lit3-32.

## Be part of it!

## TODO for the website

* Add usb probes
* Add some experiments under "use cases"
* Add a "signal" section
  * Add some scan conversion
  * Add some examples of signal processing
