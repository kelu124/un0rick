# Setting up the board for Raspberry Pi acquisitions

* Used:
  * [this version of the python lib](https://github.com/kelu124/pyUn0-lib/blob/19f25e1c30a8894a719d18258b2e8e23f80866c3/pyUn0.py).
  * [the v1.1 firmware binary](https://github.com/kelu124/un0rick/raw/master/bins/v1.1.bin)

## How to connect

1. Use the Rpi or Computer to connect to the FPGA
2. __Setup the jumper__ according to SPI master choice (USB or Rpi)
3. __Power up__ via a USB cable
4. __Configuration of the acquisition__: send to FPGA the configuration registers via SPI 
5. Set the register _EF_ to initiliaze memory (read and write pointers at 0)
6. __Start the acquisition__, triging it up using the software, or with the onboard hardware trig button
7. Do _one SPI transaction_ and ignore the data received
8. Read the measures via SPI

# How to setup the board using only a RaspberryPi (here with RPi 4)

## Putting the board together

Need a few feet to raise the board a bit above the ground, two 2x20 headers, and a SMA.

# Software side

## Updating the raspberry tools

You may need to install new packages, especially to communicate with the fpga.

``` 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools libasound2-dev python3-numpy python-numpy
sudo apt-get install python-dev libatlas-base-dev
```

From a general perspective, it may be worth trying to keep your tools up to date with:

```
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

If you face SPI / GPIOs issues, and that you are using a RPi4, you may want to follow [these hints](http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-updated-to-2-52-for-the-raspberry-pi-4b/) to update WiringPi. In short:

```
cd /tmp
wget https://project-downloads.drogon.net/wiringpi-latest.deb
sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb
gpio -v
```

to check you're using v2.52 or above.

## Updating the python tools

On the raspberry pi, use pip to install the following modules:

```
pip3 install smbus2 RPi.GPIO PyAudio matplotlib numpy scipy spidev
```



## How to update the FPGA binary

1. Use a PC with (for example) diamond programmer or (preferred ;) ) using iceprog.
2. Setup the the jumper for FPGA update (on J23, equivalent or Jumper4, named "SPI FT if IN")
3. Connect the USB
4. Program via (for example) the diamong programmer application
5. The LED program shall be lit when programmed successfully.

## Installing iceprog to flash the fpga

iceprog is the software used to put the fpga on the flash storage on the board, which will be read by the fpga on boot. The easiest way is to :

```
sudo apt install fpga-icestorm
```

If this doesn't work, then this may work:

```
sudo apt-get install libftdi-dev git gcc 
git clone https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm.git
cd iceprog
make 
sudo make install
```

This will create and install the iceprog utility, used to flash the fpga program (bitstream).

Prepare the jumper here :

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/un0rick/master/images/program.jpg)

Then, plug an usb cable from the RPi to the board (not connected using the raspberry pi header).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/echomods/master/matty/images/P_20191123_144920.jpg)

Check that the FTDI device is well created by typing:

```
dmesg
```

and then flash the FPGA by doing:

```
wget https://github.com/kelu124/un0rick/raw/master/bins/v1.1.bin
iceprog v1.1.bin
```

This should flash the board:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/echomods/master/matty/v1.01/iceprog.png)

If you do not have a success here, you may want to have a look at how to connect FTDI devices to your computer (see for example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36633819/iceprog-cant-find-ice-ftdi-usb-device-linux-permission-issue ). Usually, one has no issues with RPi fresh out of the box.

## Physical setup / connections for the lib acquisitions

### Pinouts

#### Raspberry Pi header

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/un0rick/master/images/un0rick_rpi_header.png)

#### FTDI breakout

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/un0rick/master/images/un0rick_ftdi.png)

### Setup

You can use a RPi4 with a ribbon cable to connect to the board, leaving the jumper on, putting one to select the high voltage level, connecting a piezo.. and that's it.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/echomods/master/matty/images/P_20191123_161358.jpg)

## Running an acquisition

### Testing the connection to the board

Then, for example to discover the board using Python, you can use the library:

```
git clone https://github.com/kelu124/pyUn0-lib.git
cd pyUn0-lib
python pyUn0.py test
```

It will download the lib, then you should see with the 'test' option a LED blink

### Testing the connection to the board

The "single" option will allow you to capture a single line, then the "process" one will create the corresponding images.

```
python pyUn0.py single
python pyUn0.py process
```

## Results

I've used this exact setup to [get the lib](https://github.com/kelu124/pyUn0-lib) examples ( https://github.com/kelu124/pyUn0-lib ).

#Â Details of the RPi binary registers and specificities

__Does not work with the USB binary!__

You don't need to read all of this, this is included in [this version of the python lib](https://github.com/kelu124/pyUn0-lib/blob/19f25e1c30a8894a719d18258b2e8e23f80866c3/pyUn0.py).

## FPGA setup

SPI is used to configure the DAC values every 5us, using the following addresses and protocol (SPI is only 8bits per CS).	
For each address:
* Send __0xAA__ to access parameters
* Followed by Send __@__ the address over 8 bits
* Followed by Send __Data__, a parameter over 8 bits

Addresses start at 0xE0 and end at 0xD0 on the default bitstream.

## How to read from the FPGA

SPI is used to read the ADC value. SPI in the case of the basic program is only 8 bits per CS.	

Master send 0. If the FPGA is doing an acquisition, the returned value is 0xAA, else the value is on 2x8 bits.

* MSB
  * 8th bit: MSB ID: set to 1
  * 6-7th bit: cycle bits: to identify a line in a sequence
  * 4-5th bits: the two inputs (TopTurn 1 and TopTurn2) in case a counter is used.
  * 1st-3th bits: ADC 7 to 9: 3 remaining bits of acquisition
* LSB	
  * 8th bit: LSB ID: set to 0 
  * 1st to 7th bits: ADC 7-0: 7 first bits of acquisition

If the master reads more data than the board has acquired, SPI will return old or incorrect values: the master has to know how many measures were done.


## DAC Configuration

SPI is used to configure the DAC values every 5us, using the following addresses and protocol (SPI is only 8bits per CS). For each register setup, you will have to send:

* Send __0xAA__ to tell the board you'll be setting a register
* Followed by Send __@__ the address over 8 bits
* Followed by Send __Data__, a parameter over 8 bits

Addresses start at 0x10 and end at 0x38. This corresponds to t = 0us for 0x10, and t = 200us for 0x38. __Data__ range from 0 to 8 bits for full amplification.

### TGC use

The gain was measured to check if [it was working](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/include/experiments/auto/20180721a.md) and yielded this gain curve according to the value put into the DAC.
