# How to setup the board using only a usb cable

# Beware! If you use this, you just need to have a usb cable plugged in.

Install jumpers and connectors as indicated in the figure below. Jumpers necessary are the white and the green ones.

# Installation 

## Preparing Python

`pip3 install pyftdi matplotlib numpy scipy`

## Installing iceprog to flash the fpga

iceprog is the software used to put the fpga on the flash storage on the board, which will be read by the fpga on boot. The easiest way is to :

`sudo apt install fpga-icestorm`

If this doesnâ€™t work, then this may work:

```
sudo apt-get install libftdi-dev git gcc 
git clone https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm.git
cd iceprog
make 
sudo make install
```

This will create and install the iceprog utility, used to flash the fpga program (bitstream).

## FTDI rules.

_Notes for Linux_: Create a file /etc/udev/rules.d/53-lattice-ftdi.rules with the following line in it to allow uploading bit-streams as unprivileged user:

`ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6014", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev", TAG+="uaccess"`

This should solve usb access rules.

## Setting jumpers

Put jumpers on the `J23` header, only on `Jumper2` and on `"SPI FT if ON"`. See at the bottom of the page for the VGA connections.


## Optional: connection for VGA

For this binary, you will need to connect VGA lines to the board, using the [header close to the buttons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/un0rick/master/images/ios.png) (beware, this image should be rotated to align with the actual board silkscreen).
 
* IO1_RPI = GREEN (color of your choice really)
  * A 270 Ohm R should be inserted in series with the line.
* IO2_RPI = VSYNC
  * A 120 Ohm R should be inserted in series with the line.
* IO4_RPI = HSYNC
  * A 120 Ohm R should be inserted in series with the line.
* GND = GND

__Beware, IO3 seems not to be working on this bin__.

Below, and example of my connections with nice resistors.

## Connect the usb cable

Check that the FTDI device is well created by typing:

`dmesg`

# Programming it

```
wget https://github.com/kelu124/un0rick/raw/master/usb/usb.bin
iceprog usb.bin
```

## Using the python lib

### In python


In essence, installing the module `pip3 install un0usb` before, or, to get a specific one:

```
wget https://github.com/kelu124/un0rick/raw/master/usb/python_lib/un0usb-0.2.6.tar.gz
pip3 install un0usb-0.2.6.tar.gz
```

Then, from a python shell, you can initialise the board with the following code.

```
import un0usb as USB # neeeds `pip3 install un0usb` before
fpga = USB.FpgaControl('ftdi://ftdi:2232:/', spi_freq=8E6) # init FTDI device 
fpga.reload() # reload configuration
fpga.reset() # reset fpga

file = fpga.stdNDTacq() # Running a standard NDT acquisition
plot = USB.FView() # Opens a viewing object
data = plot.readfile(file) # plots it
```

After the `fpga.reset()` command, D7 should be starting to blink.

### Managing the VGA output

If not jumper is put on `Jumper2`, you should start having on the VGA output a picture of what is happening on the board in real time. The board registers and parameters can be set via USB, but acquisition triggers is managed by the board itself, not allowing you to read from the buffer.

![LARGE IMAGE, BEWARE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kelu124/un0rick/master/images/20210117_180634.gif)

If a jumper is set on `Jumper2`, the display with only display the latest acquisition, and the board will be fully controlable via USB, including the option to read from the board RAM.

### Result

The [full log is here](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/matty/20201107a/20201107a.ipynb).

## Going in deeper details

###

The lib and examples should be self sufficient. However, you can go at a deeper level by exploring the un0usb library.

### Pulser control

To control the waveform, one would set the `fpga.csr.ponw`, `fpga.csr.interw` and `fpga.csr.poffw`, that are respectively integers for setting the width (timing) of the pulse, width of a relaxation period before damping, and then duration of damping. Unit are (1/128us).

The `fpga.csr.initdel` register is the delay between the beginning of the acquisiton and the pulse. 

```
fpga.csr.initdel = InitDel
fpga.csr.ponw = PONWidth
fpga.csr.interw = INTERWidth
fpga.csr.poffw = PDAMP
```

Below is plotted amplitude of an echo as a function of the `fpga.csr.ponw` for a 4MHz transducer. One sees that a setting at `16` provides most

(See [full experiment here](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/tree/master/matty/20201031a)).

### Gain and acquisitions

And do acquisitions with `acq_res = fpga.do_acquisition(acq_lines=32, gain=gain, double_rate=True)` which will return an array of `acq_lines` acquisitions, of length 256us at 64Msps.
`double_rate=True` provides a half clock offset to odd lines, so that one can interleave two subsequent acquisition to have, in a fixed setting, a 128Msps acquisition.

The `gain` setting is an array of integers, of length 32, that can range from 0 to 1023, controlling gain for each of the 32 8us-segment of acquisition within the 256us line. 


### Other registers

* `fpga.csr.led3 = 0` sets LED3 off. led1, led2, led3 are possible, can be set to 0 or 1.
* `fpga.csr.topturnX` reads input 1 to 3 on the input header.
* `fpga.csr.jumperX` reads jumper 1 to 3 close to the programming jumper.
* `fpga.csr.outXice` writes/reads output 1 to 3.
* `fpga.csr.nblines = acq_lines - 1` is the register controlling the number of lines acquired.
* `fpga.csr.dacout` reads the DAC/TGC/VGA level outside of acquisitions.
* `fpga.csr.acqstart = 1` to start the acquisition
* `fpga.csr.drmode = int(double_rate)` triggers the interleaving mode.
* `fpga.csr.acqstart = 1` to start the acquisition
* `fpga.csr.acqdone` is equal to 0 during acquisitions.
* `fpga.csr.author` reads the ID of the author of the binary.
  * `1` : kelu124
* `fpga.csr.version` reads the ID of the author's binary.
  * `1` The current binary version 

Don't hesitate to improve the gateware and push more here.
