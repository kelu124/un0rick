# Overview

This project has a specific target of providing a __low-cost, open source technological kit to allow scientists, academics, hackers, makers or OSHW fans to hack their way to ultrasound imaging__ - below 500$ - at home, with no specific equipment required. This piece of hardware follows [the murgen dev-kit](https://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit) and the [echomods](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/), previous iterations. Those were simpler, less robust and less cost-efficient than this kit.
