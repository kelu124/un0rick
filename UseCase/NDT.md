#Â Use of the hardware for NDT

In the experiments below, NDT tests were done on a steel block used for calibration. A dual transducer element was used, with a jumper removed from the board to allow for different TX and RX paths. 

## Setup

## Overview of the results

Unsurprisingly, one will see multiple echoes at different depths, depending on the calibration block.
