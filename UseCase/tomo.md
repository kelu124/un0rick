# Ultrasound tomography

During an experiment with students, the board was used to capture tomographic data. The transducer was fixed, when the target was rotating on itself during acquisition.

The image was reconstructed after that.

### Setup

The piezo was fixed, with the PU targets glued to a rotating disk.

## Reconstruction of the image

Finally, the image was rebuilt.
