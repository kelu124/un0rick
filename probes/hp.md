# Probe model

* `HP 21412A` (seems like `HP 21402A` would work too). A good choice to try mechanical scanning. Simple piezo, simple motor.

Make sure that the liquid is present in the head.

# Connections

* The motor (black/white pair) is driven by a DRV8834 at 5V. Setup is as follows:
  * STEP: 400us period square wave.
  * M1: HIGH
  * !SLEEP: HIGH
  * Connection to motor: A1/A2 or B1/B2
* Piezo: yellow coax
