# Benchmarking with the un0rick board

## Acquisitions on the lit3rick, medium gain, using onboard enveloppe detection

## Same, with onboard 5V supply

## Different HV strategies on board

## Checking the level of noise in each board, at max gain (no transducer plugged).

the up5k board is a bit better =)

## Is there any difference between positive and negative pulses?

### Overview

#### Detail of an echo

## Can we play with the width of pulses if we want to alternate positive and negative pulses?
