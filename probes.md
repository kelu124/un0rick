# Experimenting with medical mechanical probes

__Beware, the setup in these experiments was such as it yields raw ultrasound signals, allowing for image reconstruction, but not _real-time_ images;__

So far, I've had luck experimenting with a couple of mechanical probes:

* [HP 21412A](probes/hp.md): a simple piezo and motor driven relatively easily at 5V. Would you want to explore acquiring ultrasound images, this is a safe bet.
* [ATL3 probe](probes/atl3.md): a great familly of mechanical probe. There are even annular ones. Great set of technology: reed switches, inductive pulses, three piezos per head.. and simple motor power supply. Plug in 5V and you're done.
* [Bard](probes/bard.md): driven by electromagnets. Teardown is quite easy, access to the head more than easy. 
* [Kretz AW14 5B A](probes/kretzaw145ba.md): first of the probes I've opened and extracted images. Can't remember though how I powered it. Need to think.
