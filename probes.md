# Experimenting with medical mechanical probes

So far, I've had luck experimenting with a couple of mechanical probes:

* [ATL probe](probes/atl3.md): a great familly of mechanical probe. There are even annular ones. Great set of technology: reed switches, inductive pulses, three piezos per head.. and simple motor power supply. Plug in 5V and you're done.
* [Bard](probes/bard.md): electromagnets. Teardown is quite easy, access to the head more than easy. 
* [HP](probes/hp.md): a simple piezo and motor driven relatively easily at 5V.
* [Kretz AW14 5B A](probes/kretzaw145ba.md): first of the series! Can't remember though how I powered it. Need to thinking.
