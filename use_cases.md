# Use cases

The two boards are designed for ultrasound pulse-echo experiments, and as such can cover different uses such as:

* [Classical pulse-echo for imaging](http://un0rick.cc/UseCase/pulse_echo)
* [Ultrasound tomography](http://un0rick.cc/UseCase/tomo)
* [Non destructive testing (NDT)](http://un0rick.cc/UseCase/NDT)

# Requirements

The pulse-echo hardware, be it the [un0rick](http://un0rick.cc/un0rick) or [lit3rick](http://un0rick.cc/lit3rick) boards were designed to first of all work straight out of the box with a Raspberry Pi. However, any microcontroller with a free SPI/i2c bus can communicate with the devices.
